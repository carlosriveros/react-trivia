This is the solution to the Trivia Game Coding Challenge

### Setup instructions
- run npm install
- run npm start


I used React Router V4 for routing

I used Redux and Redux-Thunk for state management even though for a small project state would be enough

I used TransitionGroup and CSSTransition to add a small fading animation on route change
