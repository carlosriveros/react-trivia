This is the solution to the Trivia Game Coding Challenge

### Setup instructions
- run npm install
- run npm start


I used React Router V4 for routing

I used Redux and Redux-Thunk for state management even though for a small project state would be enough

I used TransitionGroup and CSSTransition to add a small fading animation on route change

The Challenge took about 6-7 hours to complete

1 hour for setting up initial folder structure, downloading and setting redux and react router

1.5 hours to get the proper state management with Redux and Thunk working

1.5 hour for creating the components

45 minutes to set up the animation

The rest of the time was used to refactor and improve the app as I coded
